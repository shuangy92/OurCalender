# OurCalender
An interactive reminder that allows sending events to your friends in the easy and intuitive manner.

PS: This was my first iOS APP that I implemeted with my friend. He was in charge of the server side and I was in charge of the client side. The motivation for this app was that we wanted to build a calendar that allows interaction. So the users can create and manage events, as well as invite friends so that a group of people can share the same event on their calendar. However soon after we started this project apple upgrated its system and added this functionality to its own calender app. Therefore the app now is no longer being updated. (Also becasue the server was down..)
